# The importance of hypoxia on alternative polyadenylation and tumor microenvironmental alterations in non-small cell lung cancer
### Data:
- `APAEventsDiff`: The differentially alternative polyadenylation (APA) events calculated in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) datasets.

### NCScore:
- `Hypoxia_scores.gmt`: The hypoxia gene set used in the NC method;
- `Hypoxia_scoresTCGA` and `Hypoxia_scoresCCLE`: The hypoxia scores in the TCGA and CCLE datasets calculated by the NC method;
- `NC2NMF_cluster3TCGA.csv` and `NC2NMF_cluster3CCLE.csv`: By integrating the two methods, classify the samples in the TCGA and CCLE datasets.
